### Introduction

We touched on the basics of what it means to write clean code all the way back in [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-clean-code). In that lesson, we discussed how you might get lost in your own code. It might have felt like a silly notion at the time, but probably by now, you've already had experience with that. Same thing has probably happened with a lot of things we covered back then, wether you remember them or not.

This lesson is an invitation to take a glance back at that earlier lesson for reminders and an opportunity to learn some cool new tricks that can make your code cleaner and just _better_.

Sound good? Let's go!
